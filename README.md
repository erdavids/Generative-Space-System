# Randomly Generated Solar Systems

A few different choices for customization that result in neat looking, poster-ready images.

Everything is extremely simple right now, but I would like to add a few things in the future.

Possible improvements:
    * Planets of different shapes
    * Orbiting moons
    * Asteroid belts
    * Vector designs
    * Better texture
