# Randomly Generated Solar Systems

A few different choices for customization that result in neat looking, poster-ready images.

Everything is extremely simple right now, but I would like to add a few improvements in the future:

  * Planets of different shapes 
  * Orbiting moons
  * Asteroid belts
  * Vector designs
  * Better texture
